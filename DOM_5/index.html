        <p>Q) What is Document Object Model?</p>
        <p>Ans) In web development, a Data Object Model (DOM) refers to a structured representation of data that allows developers to interact with and manipulate data in a consistent way. It is often used to represent complex data structures, such as those found in databases or APIs, in a way that can be easily accessed and modified by web applications. The Data Object Model typically consists of objects that encapsulate data and provide methods for accessing and manipulating that data.</p>
